Singleton Pattern: 
        --> The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one
            instance, and provides a global point of access to it.


When to Use:
    --> There are many objects we only need one of: thread pools, caches, dialog boxes, objects that handle
        preferences and registry settings, objects used for logging, and objects that act as device drivers to devices
        like printers and graphics cards. In fact, for many of these types of objects, if we were to instantiate
        more than one we’d run into all sorts of problems like incorrect program behavior, overuse of resources, or
        inconsistent results.
    --> the Singleton Pattern is a time-tested method for ensuring only one object gets created. The
        Singleton Pattern also gives us a global point of access, just like a global variable, but without the downsides.    

Issues:
    --> In an multi-threaded environment, Race condtion may lead to creation of more than one instances of objects,
        and synchronizing a method can decrease performance by a factor of 100.
    --> Assuming we would never require more than 1 instances of class that might not be true.
    --> Makes testing difficult. 


Solution : 
        public class Singleton {
            
            private volatile static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
            //https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/volatile-keyword-in-java/

            private Singleton() {}
            
            public static Singleton getInstance() {
            
                if(uniqueInstance == null){
                    if(uniqueInstance == null){
                        uniqueInstance = new Singleton(); 
                    }
            
                }
            }
        }


Design Principle

    Identify the aspects of your
    application that vary and separate
    them from what stays the same. 

    Program to an interface, not an
    implementation

    Favor composition over inheritance.

    Strive for loosely coupled designs
    between objects that interact.

    Classes should be open
    for extension, but closed for
    modifi cation.

    Conditionals returning provokes if-else 
    condtions in your system.(*BAD THING)

    designs should closed for modificatiion
    but open for extension.

    identify the aspects that vary and 
    separate them from what stays the same.

    Depend upon abstractions. Do not
    depend upon concrete classes.
