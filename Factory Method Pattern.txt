Factory Method Pattern: 
        --> Main Idea: separating the code for intantiation to separate class
                       because instatiation might be commplicated in terms of code 
                       written or when we don't know which subclass we are going to instantiate
                       (the animal subclass example which will lead to lots of if-else conditionals)

                       *So we are encapsulating the logic of instantiation.

        --> The Factory Method pattern Defines an Interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses
            decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method lets the class defer instatiation 
            to subclasses.

When to Use:
        --> When you don't knnow ahead of time what class object you need
        --> To centralise class selection code
        --> Want to encapsulate object creation

Design Principle

    Identify the aspects of your
    application that vary and separate
    them from what stays the same. 

    Program to an interface, not an
    implementation

    Favor composition over inheritance.

    Strive for loosely coupled designs
    between objects that interact.

    Classes should be open
    for extension, but closed for
    modifi cation.

    Conditionals returning provokes if-else 
    condtions in your system.(*BAD THING)

    designs should closed for modificatiion
    but open for extension.

    identify the aspects that vary and 
    separate them from what stays the same.
